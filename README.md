## Short description

Our project is a contract that optionally enables any DAO proposal to use sortition for voting. Sortition is the practice of randomly selecting a small group of eligible, unique voters from the wider population (e.g. 10%) to make decisions for the whole group (like a jury panel). Our MVP will include logic that selects the voters for the proposal being submitted using Chainlink VRF v2, deployed through Tatum, and leverage WorldCoin to prevent sybil attacks.
